# cola_manuscript


This repository contains scripts for the manuscript '**cola: an R/Bioconductor Package for Consensus Partitioning through a General Framework**'. Go to each folder to see the detailed description for each script.


In the scripts, the _cola_ anslysis are frequently submitted to computing clusters.
Here we use [the _bsub_ package](https://github.com/jokergoo/bsub) to submit jobs to 
[the LSF cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_LSF) (the `bsub` system).
